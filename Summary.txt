Data analysis with Python - Students performance analysis :
    
    ➡Student performance analysis is essential for understanding the factors that 
influence academic success. Happy to share my project, where I analyzed students dataset,
focused on final grades (G3) and their relationships with various factors such as study 
time and gender. The goal is to derive insights that can help improve student outcomes. 

1) Data Cleaning :
    ➡Ensured the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. It helps
improve the reliability of insights derived from the data.

2) Data Preprocessing :
2.1) Handled Missing Values :
    ➡Checked for missing values.
    Replaced missing values in numerical columns with their median.
    Alternatively, rows with missing values could be dropped.
2.2) Removing Duplicates :
    ➡Identified and removed duplicate entries present in the dataset

3) Data Analysis and Visualization :
3.1) Average Final Grade (G3) :
    ➡The mean final grade among students was calculated.
3.2) Number of Students Scoring Above 15 :
    ➡Counted students with G3 > 15.
3.3) Correlation Between Study Time and Final Grade
    ➡Computed correlation and include correlation value, positive/negative,
    and strength of correlation.
    Observation: A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship.
3.4) Gender-Based Performance Analysis :
    ➡Compared average G3 between male and female students.
    Observation: A bar chart was created to compare gender-wise performance.

4) Visualizations :
4.1) Histogram of Final Grades (G3) :
    ➡A histogram was plotted to analyze the distribution of final grades.
4.2) Scatter Plot: Study Time vs. Final Grade :
    ➡A scatter plot was used to identify any trends between study time and
    final grades.
4.3) Bar Chart: Average Final Grade by Gender :
    ➡A bar chart was plotted to compare the average final grade among male 
    and female students.

5) Tools used : Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
